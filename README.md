Sales
=====

The current process is:

![Serving Process](http://oneacrecafe.github.io/sales/doc/current_process.svg)

1. The server takes the customers' order on paper. The order includes a table number and the size of party.
2. The server gives the order to an operator who enters it into a NCR P1515 running Windows XP connected to an Epson M244A which prints a reciept and a ticket.
3. The ticket goes to the kitchen to be filled.
4. The order comes back with the ticket.
5. The reciept is given to the customers.
6. The customers pay at another P1515 with a cash drawer.

The process that I like best is:

![Serving Process](http://oneacrecafe.github.io/sales/doc/tablet_process.svg)

1. The server takes the customers' order on a tablet.
2. A ticket prints in the kitchen.
3. The ticket comes back with the order.
4. The server prints a reciept which includes a QR code linking to a page for the meal.
5. The cutomer pays via a mobile device.
6. Or the customer pays at the cashier.
